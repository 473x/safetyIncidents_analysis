# Analysis of patient reported safety incidents in online feedback to acute hospitals
The Python Jupyter notebook 'patientReportedIncidents.ipynb' reports an analysis of patient feedback on acute NHS trusts (hospital conglomerates). The aim of the analysis is to create a natural language processing algorithm that can estimate the likelihood that online patient feedback reports a safety incident. A demonstration of the final algorithm is available [here](https://tinyurl.com/safetyIncidentsDemo) (note: this can take up to 10 minutes to load). Although the raw data used in the analysis cannot be hosted here, it is publicly available. The feedback data is from [Care Opinion](https://www.careopinion.org.uk/) and the secondary data is from [NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk/). The manually coded data, used to validate the automated methodology, is in the file 'data_manualClassifications.xlsx'.
