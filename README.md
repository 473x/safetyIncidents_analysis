# Analysis of patient reported safety incidents in online feedback to acute hospitals
The Python Jupyter notebook (patientReportedIncidents.ipynb) reports an analysis of patient feedback on acute NHS trusts (hospital conglomerates). Although the raw data cannot be hosted here, it is publicly available. The feedback data is from [Care Opinion](https://www.careopinion.org.uk/) and the secondary data is from [NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk/). The manually coded data, used to validate the automated methodology, is in the file 'data_manualClassifications.xlsx'.
