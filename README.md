# Analysis of patient reported safety incidents in online feedback
The Python Jupyter notebook '[patientReportedIncidents.ipynb](https://github.com/473x/safetyIncidents_analysis/blob/main/patientReportedIncidents.ipynb)' reports an analysis of patient feedback on acute NHS trusts (hospital conglomerates). The aim of the analysis is to create a natural language processing algorithm that can estimate the likelihood that online patient feedback reports a safety incident. The notebook documents all the stages of the analysis and the outputs at each stage. This repository includes:

1) A detailed description of the [data sources](https://github.com/473x/safetyIncidents_analysis/raw/main/dataSources.pdf)
2) The [guidelines](https://github.com/473x/safetyIncidents_analysis/raw/main/guidelinesForManualClassification.pdf) used for manually classifying the patient feedback.
3) The manually classified [data](https://github.com/473x/safetyIncidents_analysis/raw/main/data_manualClassifications.xlsx), with IDs that link back to the original data on [Care Opinion](https://www.careopinion.org.uk/).
4) A [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/473x/safetyIncidents_analysis/blob/main/patientReportedIncidents.ipynb) with the Python code for the analysis ([html version](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/473x/safetyIncidents_analysis/main/patientReportedIncidents.html)).
5) An [interactive demonstration](https://tinyurl.com/safetyIncidentsDemo) of the algorithm (note: this takes a few minutes to start and will timeout after a few minutes).
